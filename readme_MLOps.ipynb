        "\n",
        "Normally Machine Learning or AI Models can be deployed directly to platforms like Microsoft Azure ML, AWS and so on. So why bother about creating a pipeline for the same. Let's say you want to deploy a new model that does the same work as the previous model, but better. How will you do it? Will you deploy it on a second REST endpoint and delete the endpoint for the first model. Let's say the model is made for a field like cricket, and it displays the probable number of runs that would be scored by a team during a match. As you would imagine, in this scenario the model has to be trained on the data of all the previous matches and on inference time, it will be given parameters like run rate, wickets down and so on to get the final prediction of runs scored. This entire process cannot be driven manually. Everything from training to testing to deployment on an endpoint has to be automated. That brings us to the first goal of Pipelines->AUTOMATION. And the second most important goal of the pipeline is ACCESS CONTROL of different parts of the pipeline and its subsequent development."
